# Granger Casaulity

A repo consisting of granger causality tests.

Any future Granger-Causality tests or ideas will be in this folder

Currently there is a single project here running a bi-directional VAR between Oil prices and US Military Spending.
This was originally done as a research project for the student association for applied statistics, and my first time working with time series. Though the hypothesis was disproved, there was some interesting lessons to be learned, which is why I have uploaded the material.

The notebook is rather messy, so I would suggest taking a look at the pdf.
