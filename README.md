# Granger Casaulity

A repo consisting of granger causality tests.

Currently there is a single project here running a bi-directional VAR between Oil prices and US Military Spending.
This was originally done as a final project for Economics 143 with Prof Bryan Graham.

Any future Granger-Causality tests or ideas will be in this folder
