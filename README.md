# Granger Casaulity

A repo consisting of granger-(pseudo)causality tests.

Any future Granger-Causality tests or ideas will be in this folder

Currently there is a single project here running a bi-directional VAR between Oil prices and US Military Spending.
This was originally done as a research project for the student association for applied statistics, and my first time working with time series. Though the identification strategy was *deeply* flawed, there was some interesting lessons to be learned.
